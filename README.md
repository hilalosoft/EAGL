# EAGL: Evolution-Aware Generation of Robust Locators

EAGL (Evolution-Aware Generation of Robust Locators): A novel technique for generating robust locators by analysing the evolution of web applications. EAGL identifies stable DOM positions—specific locations in the DOM tree that persist across versions—using six structural DOM features, and uses them as anchors to construct robust locators.
